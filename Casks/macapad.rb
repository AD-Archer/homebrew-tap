  caveats do
    <<~EOS
      Macapad is unsigned, so macOS will block it on first launch. To allow it, run:
        xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Macapad.app

      Macapad needs Accessibility access to press keys for you:
        System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility

      Because it's unsigned, macOS treats every update as a new app. After upgrading,
      remove Macapad from the Accessibility list and add it again.
